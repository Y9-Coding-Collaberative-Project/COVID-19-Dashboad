            <p class="response">As you well know at this point, the government has issued a mandatory self isolation on everybody especially those returning from other countries. Lately however, the government is begining to lift certain restrictions but you should still refrain from being within 2 meters of people. Doctors and other first line emergency workers have been tirelessly treated those infected with the virus as well as researching a possible vaccine.</p>

            <h1>What can you do?</h1>
            <p class="response">Firstly, just stay home. Follow the government mandated self isolation ond only go outside for essential reasons such as groceries. In order to limit the spread physical distance so try and avoid people if walking on the sidewalk. Allways go out with gloves and a mask and allways thoroughly wash your hands whenever you enter your house.</p>
